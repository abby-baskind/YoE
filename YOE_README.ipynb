    "# `GFDL-ESM4.gr.historical.Omon.r1i1p1f1`\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected CMIP6 model is GFDL-ESM4 (Dunne et al., 2020; Stock et al., 2020). It has been regridded onto a 1°x1° lat-lon grid. The `historical` experiment on the `Omon` table runs from 1-15-1850 to 12-15-2014 with data provided monthly. I have selected the first ensemble member, `r1i1p1f1`, as that is the only one provided.\n",

    "\n",
    "I selected the following variables. For 3D variables (i.e. not surface variables), I selected the first depth level, which corresponds to 2.5m depth. In a future version, I should look for surface variables to replace these.\n",

    "### Calculated Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables are either in inconvenient units or not provided in the model. To convert from mol m-3 to umol kg-1, I first calculated density as potential density referenced to the surface using the `gsw` package and then used density as part of a conversion factor `conv`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ds['sigma0'] = gsw.sigma0(ds['sos'],ds['tos'])\n",
    "\n",
    "conv = 1e6/(1000 + ds['sigma0'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fugacity and Omega_arag were not provided by the model. I calculated these using DIC, TA, temperature, and salinity, using `PyCO2SYS`. I based this method on [Terhaar et al. (2021, Biogeosciences)](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/2221/2021/bg-18-2221-2021-discussion.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "results = pyco2.sys(par1=ds['talk']*conv,par2=ds['dissic']*conv,\n",
    "                       par1_type=1,par2_type=2, salinity = ds['sos'], temperature = ds['tos'])\n",
    "``` \n",
    "## Detrending Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The manuscript suggests detrending \"1.89 µatm yr-1 for fCO2, -0.0018 yr-1 for pH and -0.0078 yr-1 for Ω from 1980s to 2010s (Bates et al., 2014).\" The SOCAT data is currently detrended, referenced to the minimum available year, which varies spatially. For the model, I referenced to 1980, as suggested by the manuscript. This means, as it currently stands, the detrending is inconsistent between SOCAT and the model, and we must decide on a consistent reference year. The detrending in the model data is done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ds['fugacity_detrended'] = (ds['fugacity'] -  1.89 * (ds['fugacity'].time.dt.year - 1980)) * xr.ones_like(ds['talk'])\n",
    "ds['ph_detrended'] = (ds['ph'] + 0.0018 * (ds['ph'].time.dt.year - 1980)) * xr.ones_like(ds['talk'])\n",
    "ds['omega_detrended'] = (ds['omega'] + 0.0078 * (ds['omega'].time.dt.year - 1980)) * xr.ones_like(ds['talk'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Selection\n",
    "Only after calculating new variables and detrending the data did I take a mean and standard deviation over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Present: 1-15-1995 to 12-15-2014\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected the last 20 years of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Past: 1-15-1850 to 12-15-1879\n",
    "\n",
    "For a reconstruction of the past, I recommend the first available 30 years of the model. Remember, the historical model starts in 1850. While a longer climatology (e.g. 50 years) might be more robust, given how late the model starts, I contend climatologies past 1880 would begin showing signs of anthropogenic influence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Future\n",
    "\n",
    "I have yet to decide which model run to use for our future projection. SSP experiments on `Omon` tables start at 1-15-2015 are initialized from the historical experiment, so they form a continuous record, but their forcings are not based on observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple SSPs to choose from. SSPs are first categorized by scenario numbers 1 through 5, with SSP1 being the most sustainable model, SSP2 being a middle of the road model, SSP3 being a model characterized by regional rivalry, SSP4 being a model characterized by widespread inequity, and SSP5 being a model of continued fossil-fuel development. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SSP is then further characterized by a 2100 climate forcing similar to the previous RCPs: 2.6 W/m2, 4.5 W/m2, 7.0 W/m2, and 8.5 W/m2. Models are required to publish \"Tier 1\" experiments, which are SSP5-8.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP2-4.5, and SSP1-2.6. Further description of the SSP experiments can be found in [O'Neill et al. (2016, Geosci. Model Dev.)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3461/2016/).\n",

    "# Restructured SOCAT data\n",
    "\n",
    "I restructured the SOCAT data calculated by Hongjie using `xarray` to make the structure more similar to the model output. As part of this restructuring, I had to adjust latitude and longitude. The model's lat-lon points are half-degrees (i.e. -89.5, -88.5, -87.5, etc.), whereas SOCAT's lat-lon points are whole degrees (i.e. -90, -89, -88, etc.). So I could compare like grid cells, I added 0.5 to SOCAT's coordinates. This may cause a slight error, but I content the error is minimal and otherwise hard to avoid, as the model does not provide data on the exact coordinates as SOCAT.\n",
